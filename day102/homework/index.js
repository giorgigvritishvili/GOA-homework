//JavaScript is known for its ability to handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Understanding how these two things work is important for writing efficient, responsive, and user-friendly applications. In this article, we will see the differences between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript with clear examples to help you.

// What is Synchronous JavaScript?
// In synchronous programming, operations are performed one after the other, in sequence. So, basically each line of code waits for the previous one to finish before proceeding to the next. This means that the program executes in a predictable, linear order, with each task being completed before the next one starts.

// Example: In this example, we have shown the synchronous nature of JavaScript.
